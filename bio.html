        <p>In high school, my English teacher wrote me a note at the end of the year saying she saw me full of contradictions. Quiet yet opinionated, easy-going but still detail-oriented. And when I look to my journey to become a designer, I think she had a point.</p>

        <p>Like any student and young adult, I wanted to find a career that I had interest if not passion in. I first studied Computer Science, because I already had fun customizing my blog I thought it would be a good start. Though learning the computer language was interesting and exciting, I felt the constant math and algorithms stifling. Not only that, I felt that the equal side of me that loved art and creative expression neglected. I then switched my pursuit to studio art, mainly printmaking. What drew me to the medium was because printmaking was all about the layout, layers, and process. It was expressing one’s ideas in a set parameter: the limit of the plate, paper, and process. At the same time, I felt unfulfilled with creating artworks that reflect my viewpoint because it was hard for me to feel like I contributed something to the world.</p>
        <p>It was during my last years finishing up my studio art degree that I realized what design is. I was advanced enough that I got to be a student-teacher for beginning printmaking classes. My absolute favorite part of that whole class is when I would brainstorm with the student with a piece that was in progress. Students would come and share the ideas that they want to express but didn’t translate in their works - yet. From then on I would provide suggestions and solutions to the problems they are facing. I would suggest, color, different types of paper, orientation, and shortcuts of the process so that the students could be satisfied with their final work. One class, I stood across the worktable from my classmate who was struggling with a piece, I mulled over the problems and provided her a solution. I thought about composition and where the audience will generally land their eyes and how she could make their eyes travel across the paper by using certain visual elements. I was more invested in solving her problem than finishing up my own project. But when I saw her face lit up, I felt like this is a place where I could thrive.</p>

        <p>After I delved into the design world, I realized the importance of empathy: not only the empathy that is required for me to connect with my client’s wishes and ideas but the empathy that is required from me to relate to the audience and users. It’s not always the case that the users agree or understand the message a client wants to convey. I realized design can be used to facilitate a mutual understanding. I come from two cultural backgrounds and like my personal traits, I find them at odds of one another time to time. In Korea, what is a sign of respect can be misconstrued as blind obedience in the US. On the same note what the western world understands as the importance of individual freedom can be interpreted as selfishness in the East Asain world. I find these clashes happen a lot in media. Thanks to the internet and social media, the world is getting smaller, people are exposed to different cultures on a daily basis. The way we communicate information needs to adapt to this crowded world and design is one of those universal languages that can bridge barriers.</p>
